    "The key to my solution is that:<br>\n",
    "You have a point <code>Gf = flag * G</code>, and since you are able to factor the order of the point <code>G</code>(or at least find it's small factors), then you are able to solve ECDLP modulo this small factors(so you find <code>flag(mod smth)</code>, and after all use <code>CRT</code> to recover the flag."
